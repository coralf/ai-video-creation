# AI Video Creation

## Overview

AI Video Creation is an open-source project aimed at automatically generating artistic works using artificial intelligence technology, including videos, images, and more. This project integrates multiple technologies such as text-to-speech (ChatTTS), speech recognition (Whisper), image generation, etc.

## Features

- **ðŸš€ Text-to-Speech**: Converts text into high-quality speech audio.
- **ðŸš€ Speech Recognition**: Converts audio files into subtitle files (SRT).
- **ðŸš€ Video Generation**: Generates videos based on subtitles and images.
- **ðŸš€ Video Project Management**: Manages multiple video projects, including creation, deletion, and viewing of projects.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Ant Design
- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, PyDub, Whisper, ChatTTS, Kolors

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
* It is recommended to create a virtual environment using conda.
* Requires Python version 3.12.
* Node.js environment version 18 or higher is recommended.
* FFmpeg needs to be installed.

   </div>

### Basic Usage
1. Write the subtitle script for storyboards
   * One image may correspond to one or more sentences. Use line breaks within a cell to separate multiple sentences.

2. Prompt Words: The AI painting model used is Kolors. Please write prompt words directly in Chinese.

3. Random Seed: Adjust this number to generate different images.

4. Generate Video: After completing all storyboard subtitle scripts and generating all images, click the "Generate Video" button to create the video.
   > Generating the video simultaneously generates audio, subtitles, image transitions, etc., which may take a long time.
